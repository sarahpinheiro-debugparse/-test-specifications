TEST SCREENING - THERMOSTAT

//Story: Your team is developing software for a thermostat controller that controls a
switch to turn the heating on and off.


    //General scenario: Creat a switch to connect a thermostat and a heater. After that, create code that runs the algorithm to save the temperature every 10 minutes.
    def “rotate function to connect a thermostat and a heater and save result every 10 minutes.


        //Scenario 1: If the temperature is greater than or equal to 23 ° C, the heater must be turned {OFF}.
        //use switch to save temperature every 10 minutes.
        Given: Save temperature;
        ServiceWorkerRegistration = Save.temperature(greater than or equal to 23 ° C)
        
        
        //thermostat shows temperature greater than or equal to 23 ° C
        When: thermostat shows temperature greater than or equal to 23 ° C
        code ; if (temperature ≥ 23 ° C)


        //check temperature, if temperature is greater than or equal to 23 ° C, the heater must be turned {OFF}.
        Then: switch captures the temperature and turns off the heater
        service turn {OFF}
        
        {
            else
        }

        //Scenario 2: If the temperature drops below 5 ° C, the heater must be switched {ON}
        //use switch to save temperature every 10 minutes.
        Given: Save temperature;
        ServiceWorkerRegistration = Save.temperature(temperature < 5 ° C)
        
        
        //thermostat shows temperature drops below 5 ° C
        When: thermostat shows temperature drops below 5 ° C
        code ; if (temperature < 5 ° C)


        //check temperature, if temperature drops below 5 ° C, the heater must be turned {ON}.
        Then: switch captures the temperature and turns off the heater
        service turn {ON}
